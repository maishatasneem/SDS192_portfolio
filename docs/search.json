This data aims to increase transparency and help prospective students and families compare colleges based on their goals and requirements. The College Scorecard was produced by the U.S. Department of Education taking data from the federal reporting from institutions, data on federal financial aid, and tax information. These were taken directly or derived from the data reported to the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS).\nFrom the dataset, we will be investigating our question using the data of 50 colleges in Massachusetts with the largest undergraduate student population. Delving deeper, we will be exploring the governance structure and retention rates. Firstly, we will group our selection of colleges based on the cities these are located in and then visualize the distribution of the type of governance structures – whether the colleges are Public, Private Non-profit, or Private For-profit. Then, we will examine the correlation between retention rates and the undergraduate population based on the type of institution to help us draw conclusions from the data.\nThe first plot explores the governance structure of the largest 50 colleges in different cities of Massachusetts. The largest 50 schools are grouped with the cities these are located in and the length of the bars indicates the number of Public, Private Non-Profit, and Private For-Profit universities in each of those cities. Notably, there are no Private For-profit college in our selection, hence the bar chart omits the category. The plot concludes Boston has the highest number of big schools, followed by Worcester, Springfield, and Cambridge. The colors of the bars indicate that overall the number of public schools is higher than the number of private colleges in our selection of the largest MA colleges.\nThe second plot explores the correlation between the undergraduate population and the retention rate. For public colleges, we can see an inconclusive positive correlation between a larger undergraduate population and a higher retention rate as the points are scattered, showing that larger public universities are likely to have a higher retention rate. However, the points for private nonprofit colleges are in a larger cluster, signifying that there isn’t a direct and obvious correlation between undergraduate student body size and retention rate.\nAssumptions and commitments that informed this data set include assuming that the colleges participate in Title IV programs (or meet similar criteria to participating institutions), and that these colleges report wholly correct data to the IPEDS. However, a lot of the data is missing as colleges did not report some data to the IPEDS. The educational institutions and organizations collecting the data have had a say regarding this dataset, and it is hard to find reliable data if the institutions don’t report their information. The benefits and harms of this dataset may be (shouldn’t be, but) that institutions can pick and choose the data they present, so that either data is missing, or it is positively skewed towards certain institutions when it’s beneficial."

The most effective collaborations explicitly outline group roles, expectations, and procedures in advance to coordinate how the group will operate, to establish mechanisms of accountability, and to mitigate the risk of conflict. It is important that, throughout the semester, you address group concerns as they come up. This may involve assigning someone to check in with team members that are falling behind, establishing expectations for attending office hours and asking for help, calling team meetings to discuss issues, or reaching out to the instructor to resolve enduring and unresolved conflicts."

For the first plot, we used the variable that gives us the cities to find the frequency distribution of the selected colleges. For the second plot, we identified the variable that gives us the retention rate and undergraduate student number\nWe specifically chose a qualitative “string” variable for the frequency distribution. For the scatterplot, we chose two quantitative variables\nThh background of the dataset along with the significance of the selected variables are elaborated on the blogpost.\n\n\nVisualization Aesthetics\nWe were able to map variables onto appropriate plot aesthetics befitting of our question, as we used both a frequency distribution and a scatter plot. We modified the graphs and implemented bold text, sized text, and made the graphs easier to read.\nFor both graphs, we were able to adjust the color to blue and red depending on the governance structures.\nWe implemented jitter into the scatter plot so that we could address overplotting, so that we could clearly see the individual points.\n\n\nPlotting Frequencies and Distributions\nA bar plot has been used to visualize the frequency distribution of the cities - a qualitative criteria - in which the selected colleges are located. Next, to find the relationship between the retention rates and undergraduate population - two quantitative characteristics - a scatterplot has been used. For both the graphs, colors have been used to explore, respectively the distribution and the relationships, of the governance structure of the selected colleges in respect to the variables used.\nBoth the graphs have chart titles, chart subtitles, axis titles, axis labels, legend labels, and caption for detailing the context.\nFinally, the findiings have been summarized on the blogpost based on the interpretation of the charts."

The most effective collaborations explicitly outline group roles, expectations, and procedures in advance to coordinate how the group will operate, to establish mechanisms of accountability, and to mitigate the risk of conflict. It is important that, throughout the semester, you address group concerns as they come up. This may involve assigning someone to check in with team members that are falling behind, establishing expectations for attending office hours and asking for help, calling team meetings to discuss issues, or reaching out to the instructor to resolve enduring and unresolved conflicts."

The aim is explore the expenditures and committee contributions for Democrat and Republicans in the presidential election.\nWe start by trying to find any correlation between the total amount of money transacted and total votes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn general, the number of total votes seems to be similar for increasing number of money transacted We do not see any significant relartionship.\nPart 2 of the analysis looks into the transactions made from the committees for candidates running in the presidential election in Pennsylvania. The two candidates running here in 2016 were Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump - the latter winning in the state. For our analysis, we get the total transaction amount for each category of transaction type for each candidate. Our initial hypothesis was that we will find some positive correlation with the amount of transactions in favor with the election result. However, we found out the highest transaction was made for Donald Trump campaign opposing his candidacy (24A).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndependent expenditure advocating the candidacy (24E) was almost similar for both the candidates. Clinton’s campaign had significantly more expenditure for communication (24F) than that of Trump’s. However, the amount of money spent against Trump’s candidacy exceeds that of Clinton’s by a huge difference. Nevertheless, despite these factors, Trump had a successful race in Pennsylvania. The bar chart effectively helps us to visualise this insight."

    "text": "This project maps out the Late Stage Breast Cancer Incidence Rates with state-level age-adjusted data from Lyman (2020). The data in this dataset are segmented by age of the women. For this project, we have taken the data for All Ages, Ages Under 50 and Ages 50 & Over. To note, this data explicitly states that it does not include Nevada and Puerto Rico, but the dataset does not mention that Indiana is missing data, so we are taking all the states (including Hawaii and Alaska) besides Nevada and Indiana for our analysis. With this data, we aimed to find whether there was a general trend of breast cancer across the USA and New England.\n\nAcross the USA…\nFor the first segment of our analysis, we explored the late stage cancer incidence rates across all the states in the USA. For all age averages, southeastern states of Mississippi, Louisiana and Georgia shows the highest incidence. Massachusetts and Arizona shows the least incidence. For under 50 age averages, the northern and eastern states show the highest incidence. Interestingly, South Dakota has one of the minimum incidence rates unlike the surrounding states. The South has a general trend of least incidence. For over 50, the trend is similar to the all ages average with Mississippi, Louisiana and Georgia having the highest incidence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcross New England…\nFor the second segment of our analysis, we explored the late stage cancer incidence rates across the New England area in the USA. For all age averages, New Hampshire and Connecticut had the highest incidence rates in the New England area, while Massachusetts had the lowest incidence rate. For under 50 age averages, Connecticut and Rhode Island show the highest incidence, while Massachusetts remains with the lowest rate. For over 50,the trend remains similar to the previous trend with all ages and under 50, showing New Hampshire with the highest rate, while Connecticut is second highest, similar to the trend in all ages. As always, Massachusetts remains the lowest incidence rate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOverall, some states show a general trend of late stage breast cancer incidence across all age groups. However, we cannot find a direct relationship between the cancer incidence rates and the geographical or population size. Therefore, we hypothesize that some other influencing factors should exist.

    "text": "This project maps out the Late Stage Breast Cancer Incidence Rates with state-level age-adjusted data from Lyman (2020). The data in this dataset are segmented by age of the women. For this project, we have taken the data for All Ages, Ages Under 50 and Ages 50 & Over. To note, this data explicitly states that it does not include Nevada and Puerto Rico, but the dataset does not mention that Indiana is missing data, so we are taking all the states (including Hawaii and Alaska) besides Nevada and Indiana for our analysis. With this data, we aimed to find whether there was a general trend of breast cancer across the USA and New England.\n\nAcross the USA…\nFor the first segment of our analysis, we explored the late stage cancer incidence rates across all the states in the USA. For all age averages, southeastern states of Mississippi, Louisiana and Georgia shows the highest incidence. Massachusetts and Arizona shows the least incidence. For under 50 age averages, the northern and eastern states show the highest incidence. Interestingly, South Dakota has one of the minimum incidence rates unlike the surrounding states. The South has a general trend of least incidence. For over 50, the trend is similar to the all ages average with Mississippi, Louisiana and Georgia having the highest incidence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcross New England…\nFor the second segment of our analysis, we explored the late stage cancer incidence rates across the New England area in the USA. For all age averages, New Hampshire and Connecticut had the highest incidence rates in the New England area, while Massachusetts had the lowest incidence rate. For under 50 age averages, Connecticut and Rhode Island show the highest incidence, while Massachusetts remains with the lowest rate. For over 50,the trend remains similar to the previous trend with all ages and under 50, showing New Hampshire with the highest rate, while Connecticut is second highest, similar to the trend in all ages. As always, Massachusetts remains the lowest incidence rate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOverall, some states show a general trend of late stage breast cancer incidence across all age groups. However, we cannot find a direct relationship between the cancer incidence rates and the geographical or population size. Therefore, we hypothesize that some other influencing factors should exist. Further metadata is required for more granular analysis. It may also help if we had data from Nevada and Indiana.\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nLyman, Jeremy. 2020. “NCI State Late Stage Breast Cancer Incidence Rates.” National Cancer Institute. https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/NCI::nci-state-late-stage-breast-cancer-incidence-rates/about."

    "text": "This project uses the the data published by the U.S Federal Election for the state of Pennsylvania in the 2015-2016 election cycle. The aim is explore the expenditures and committee contributions for Democrat and Republicans in the presidential election.\nWe start by trying to find any correlation between the total amount of money transacted and total votes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn general, the number of total votes seems to be similar for increasing number of money transacted We do not see any significant relartionship.\nPart 2 of the analysis looks into the transactions made from the committees for candidates running in the presidential election in Pennsylvania. The two candidates running here in 2016 were Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump - the latter winning in the state. For our analysis, we get the total transaction amount for each category of transaction type for each candidate. Our initial hypothesis was that we will find some positive correlation with the amount of transactions in favor with the election result. However, we found out the highest transaction was made for Donald Trump campaign opposing his candidacy (24A).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndependent expenditure advocating the candidacy (24E) was almost similar for both the candidates. Clinton’s campaign had significantly more expenditure for communication (24F) than that of Trump’s. However, the amount of money spent against Trump’s candidacy exceeds that of Clinton’s by a huge difference. Nevertheless, despite these factors, Trump had a successful race in Pennsylvania. The bar chart effectively helps us to visualise this insight."
